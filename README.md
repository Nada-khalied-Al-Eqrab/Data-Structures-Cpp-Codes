# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains clean and well-structured **C++ implementations** of fundamental **Data Structures**.
It is designed for practice, revision, and quick reference for computer science students and developers.

## Implemented Data Structures

### Linear Data Structures
- **Classes & OOP Basics**
- **Linked List**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal
- **Stack**
  - Array-based Stack
  - Linked List-based Stack
- **Queue**
  - Linear Queue
  - Circular Queue

### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Tree**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - Tree Traversals:
    - Inorder
    - Preorder
    - Postorder
    - Level Order

---

## Repository Purpose
- Practice Data Structures using **C++**
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Provide a clear reference for common data structure implementations
- Useful for university courses, exams, and technical interviews
